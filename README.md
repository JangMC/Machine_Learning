The analysis explores different classification methods to predict which banking clients will be most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression methods were evaluated using the bank dataset with 4521 observations regarding client banking history. To evaluate the methods, a cross-validation design was used and the area under the ROC curve was used as an index of classification performance. The analysis uses three binary, explanatory variables: default, housing, and loan to predict the success of certain clients accepting a term deposit from telephone marketing campaigns.

The analysis compares two methods leveraging random forest classification on the MINIST dataset 1) with all expantory variables, and 2) with a reduced set of explantory variables.

The analysis explores different machine learning methods with the intent to complement conventional methods for assessing the market value of residential real estate in Boston. The Boston Housing Study, with 506 observations, is used to evaluate different regression modeling techniques within a cross-validation design. All observations are used, the median value of homes in thousands of 1970 dollars will is used as the response variable, and all explanatory variables are used with the exception of neighborhood.

The fanalysis explores different machine learning methods with the intent to complement conventional methods for assessing the market value of residential real estate in Boston. The Boston Housing Study, with 506 observations, is used to evaluate different regression modeling techniques within a cross-validation design. In addition, random forests and boosting methods are employed. All observationsare  used, the median value of homes in thousands of 1970 dollars is used as the response variable, and all explanatory variables are used with the exception of neighborhood.
